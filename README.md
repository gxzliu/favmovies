This project creates a movie trailer website where users can see the titles of my favorite movies and their storylines, movie posters, Rotten Tomato rating, and movie trailer (upon clicking on the movie poster).

To run this code, simply navigate to the folder containing this readme, media.py, fresh_tomatoes.py, and entertainment_center.py in terminal. Then enter the command $python entertainment_center.py and a local HTML file should pop up in your browser.
